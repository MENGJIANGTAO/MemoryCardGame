# MemoryCardGame

This is a simple memory card game which I created to use what I've been learnt by watching Epic's UE4 tutorials over the last few months.

The object of the game is to find matching numbered cards until the cards are all found, as quickly as possible.

Features that come to mind that could be added:

- High score retention
- Difficulty modes (fewer / more cards)
